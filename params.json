{"name":"Clicky Auto Corp","tagline":"There's nothing more glitzy than a brand new Clicky. Clicky Auto Corp! A multi-player incremental game based on Golang, Redis, HTML, and JavaScript.","body":"# Clicky Auto Corp\r\n\r\nThis is the developer website for the game Clicky Auto Corp.\r\n\r\n## Filing Issues\r\n\r\nIssue trackers are awesome, but there are a few tips filers should keep in mind:\r\n\r\n1. Use a short descriptive title. Many good issues begin with a verb.\r\n2. Know the difference between a bug and feature\r\n3. For bugs include a 'Steps to Replicate:' section\r\n4. A 'Prefered Behaviour:' section can be included if appropriate\r\n5. Don't feel too bad if issues aren't accepted. Some ideas aren't practical in the short term, but may come back.\r\n6. All discussion should add to the resolution. No 'me too!'s\r\n\r\nRead the [GitHub guide about issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Submitting Patches\r\n\r\nThere are a few rules to follow:\r\n\r\n1. No patches without an issue. This to keep from working\r\n2. One issue per patch (there is wiggle room for related issues)\r\n3. Include issue number(s) in the patch/commit comment\r\n3. Patch against the beta branch\r\n4. Run tests before submitting\r\n5. Custom code is gifted to the project (Attribution for significant contributions may be worked out)\r\n\r\nI suspect the last point will raise the biggest hackles, but there can be all sorts of hassles otherwise. Most notably is if sometime in the decades to come we decide to change from the MIT license to something else.","google":"UA-55430900-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
